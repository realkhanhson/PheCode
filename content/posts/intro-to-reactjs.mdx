## Try React

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need.
Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered
app, the links in this section will help you get started.

## Online Playgrounds

If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on
CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local
filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple
demos.

## Add React to a Website

You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained
to a few dynamic widgets.

## Create a New React App

When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a
minute to set up!

As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains
we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full
advantage of the rich React ecosystem. Learn how.
